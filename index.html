					<h2>Car of Commerce Chute (Missouri River)</h2>
					<q> The Missouri River was notorious for destroying steamboat captains and steamboats. The Missouri Riverâ€™s
shallow ever-changing channel, snags and the velocity of the moving water spelled doom
for many of the boats. In 1832 the Car of Commerce sank in the chute between Sioux
Passage and Pelican Island.</q> <cite><a href="https://www.stlouisco.com/Portals/8/docs/Document%20Library/parks/PDFs/Trail%20Guides/Sioux%20Passage%20Park%20Trail%20Guide.pdf">St. Louis County Parks</a></cite>
					<p>The trip began at Sioux Passage park. The initial plan was to paddle upstream through the Car of Commerce Chute and then around the other side of Pelican Island on the main channel of the Missouri River. Upon arriving at the boat ramp, we decided the current was a little too strong to paddle up the chute and went down the road to find a different put-in. A sympathetic resident saw us looking around and offered to let us use his property to access the river.</p>
					<p>Almost immediately on entering the water we encountered strong eddies and sideways currents. After fighting these for about a mile we traversed the rapids created by the barely submerged low-water dam at the west end of the chute. This was probably the most exciting part of the entire trip as the back channel was very calm other than a little rough water created by the submerged wing dam at the east end.</p>
					<p>The trip took about two hours and was overall enjoyable and moderately challenging. I would like to take the trip again and actually paddle up the chute and around the other side of the island for a little bit longer adventure.</p>
					<p>The closest river gauge (St. Charles) was reading 19.41 ft with mostly clear skies and warm air temperature.</p>

					<h2>Brickhouse Slough (Mississippi River)</h2>
					<q>Viewed from the limestone bluffs of Illinois high above the Mississippi River, the glow of the small light, a half-mile away on the Missouri shore, appears as two; one atop the weathered pole, the other a reflection on the stained water of Brick House Slough.</q> <cite><a href="http://advantagenews.com/features/commentary/the-light-from-brick-house-slough/">Larry Reid for Advantage News</a></cite>

			<p>When paddling <em>always</em> use proper safety equipment and do not paddle above your skill level. These descriptions are personal experience and do not reflect current river conditions. My having paddled a particular body of water does not mean it is safe or advisable.</p>
